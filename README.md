# Description
 This is my tutorial project.
 I made it to learn how to use: 
	- Java Servlet
	- Tomcat 
	- Ajax
	- Gson
	- Maven
# How to use
 - first you must build project with Maven.
 - then deploy assembled .war file on some application server.
 - run your browser and go to localhost/index.html

 I prefere Apache Tomcat servlet container, 
 because very easy to configure this framework and start to work.
